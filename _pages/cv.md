Education
======
* B.E. (Hons.) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, BITS Pilani - 2019

Work experience
======
* Texas Instruments, Bangalore, India (July 2019 - Present)
  * Characterization of a 14-bit Ultra-Low-Power DAC. 

* Research Assistant, BITS Pilani (August 2017 - December 2018)
  * Investigated both signal processing and circuit techniques for reference spur reduction in Analog Charge-Pump Phase-Locked Loops; Signal Processing techniques include Pulse Repetition and Randomisation.
  * Worked on a novel Phase-Frequency Detector architecture to tackle the problem of PFD/CP nonlinearity in Fractional-N PLLs. Simulation results showed that even in the presence of non-idealities, this method offered a lower spur than the existing techniques.
  * Carried out a study of loop-filter area reduction techniques in Analog Dual Charge-Pump PLLs.
  * Performed a detailed study of sampled loop-filter architecture and developed an LTI Continuous Time model of the Sampled Loop-Filter Charge-Pump PLL, to examine the effects of switch ON-time and its sizing on the PLL loop dynamics.
  * Investigated a wide swing loop filter capacitor leakage current cancellation circuit that tracks the control voltage and process variation.
