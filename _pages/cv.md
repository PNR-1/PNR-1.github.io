Education
======
* B.E. (Hons.) in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, BITS Pilani - 2019

Work experience
======
* Texas Instruments, Bangalore, India (July 2019 - Present)
  * Characterization of a 14-bit Ultra-Low-Power DAC. 

* Research Assistant, BITS Pilani (August 2017 - December 2018)
  * Investigated both signal processing and circuit techniques for reference spur reduction in Analog Charge-Pump Phase-Locked Loops; Signal Processing techniques include Pulse Repetition and Randomisation.
  * Worked on a novel Phase-Frequency Detector architecture to tackle the problem of PFD/CP nonlinearity in Fractional-N PLLs. Simulation results showed that even in the presence of non-idealities, this method offered a lower spur than the existing techniques.
  * Carried out a study of loop-filter area reduction techniques in Analog Dual Charge-Pump PLLs.
  * Performed a detailed study of sampled loop-filter architecture and developed an LTI Continuous Time model of the Sampled Loop-Filter Charge-Pump PLL, to examine the effects of switch ON-time and its sizing on the PLL loop dynamics.
  * Investigated a wide swing loop filter capacitor leakage current cancellation circuit that tracks the control voltage and process variation.
  
* Research Assistant, BITS Pilani (May 2016 - August 2017)
  * Studied the optimal architecture for Adversarial Neural Agents in asymmetric board games with imperfect information.
  * Developed a Fuzzy-Granular Decision Tree, which gave a 20% increase in accuracy over existing work.

Awards
======
* Institute Merit Scholarship: Awarded tuition fee waiver for academic excellence. (January 2017 - June 2019)
* Ranked 2nd amongst a batch of 73 students during undergraduate study at BITS Pilani.

Internships
======
* Texas Instruments, Bangalore, India (January 2019 - June 2019)
  * Wrote the Final Test program of the device DRV8304S for the Automatic Test Equipment (ETS-364). Performed ATE characterization of the device and Functional Validation of its SPI functionality.
  * Liaised with the Applications and Design teams to understand customer issues and reproduce them on our lab benches.
  
* Central Electronics Engineering Research Institute, Chennai, India (May 2017 - July 2017)
  * Worked on the multivariate analysis for quality assessment of agro-food industry products using non-destructive Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy techniques.
  * Developed a Signal Pre-processing toolbox in MATLAB, to correct measurement errors in NIR Spectral Data. Further implemented regression, support vector machine, K-means to characterize the composition of new samples against existing baselines.
